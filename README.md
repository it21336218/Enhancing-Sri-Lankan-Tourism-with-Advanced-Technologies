# **Research Problem**

Sri Lanka's tourism industry is struggling to adapt to post-pandemic challenges, natural disasters, and intense global competition, with traditional methods failing to meet the expectations of modern travelers who seek immersive, personalized, and real-time experiences. The critical issue lies in the absence of advanced technological solutions, such as augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and real-time data analytics, tailored to enhance visitor experiences, optimize operations, and ensure safety, thus limiting the industry's ability to attract and retain tourists effectively.
